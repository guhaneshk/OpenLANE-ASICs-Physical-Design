# SKY130 Day 2: Good vs Bad Floorplan and Introduction to Library Cells

## Chip Floor Planning Considerations
### Utilization factor and aspect ratio

* Net list- A netlist basically defines the connectivty between all the components; example below:
<img width="1004" height="587" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6f2326a-e47a-479a-a269-988a0cdf1867" />

* When defining the deminions of the chip, we are mosltly dependent on the **logic gates.**
* Utilization Factor: **(Area Occupied by Netlist)/(Total Area of the Core)**

* Aspect Ratio : Height/ Width

### Utilization factor and aspect rat

*Pre placed cells can be divided into blocks and still perform the same intended taks, but the thing is- pre placced cells should be really well designed because they are essentially complex logic gates that can be reused.
Image down below:

We essentially do this by **extending** the **IO Pins**:

<img width="532" height="225" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d087bb74-eff3-4530-8c0f-53a8c81845ab" />

* As we can see we split the two blocks into two seperate IP's or modules:

<img width="823" height="374" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3053a4df-ed07-452c-a9b6-4d22dfafdec3" />

**Other IP's such as memory, clock-gating cells, etc**

 * The arrangement of these IP's in a chip is called as **Floorplanning**.
 * **Automated Placement**

### De-coupling capacitors

* **Pre-Placed Cells** should be placed in such a way that- after placing it, It **cannot be moved afterward.**
* We have to surround these pre-placed cells with **Decoupling Capacitors.**

<img width="970" height="527" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/326f9966-0f5b-42aa-b282-066f399ee6d9" />

* De-coupling capacitors are filled with charges and it matchhes the voltage of the power supply as well.
* The amount of current that respective circuit needs for changing logic is provided by the de-coupling capacitors.
* When there's no switching happening, the De-coupling capacitor replenshes its current within the free time.

### Power Planning

* The **inverter** **dicharges** all the logic 1's to logic 0 and vice versa- and all logic 0's will **charge** to logic 1.

This is what happens:

<img width="786" height="269" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/565cc9af-b5ec-42c6-b947-2209b203c2b3" />

* Best way to solve this problem is to add more power supplies all around:

**Better version**:

### Pin placement and logical cell placement blockage

* **Complete design:**

* The connectivity information between the gates is verilog and is called as the **"Netlist"**.

**Pin placement and logical cell placement blockage:**

### Steps to run floorplan using OPENLANE

* The content inside the README file under the configurations dir:
<img width="1909" height="902" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/191edc3c-5696-4b5d-82ba-5db8d1bec068" />

* Specifically for **floorplanning:**
<img width="1842" height="841" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1f73c6c-6c03-4d6e-8dd0-7a93848af97a" />

* Config.tcl file:
<img width="1278" height="448" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/54a5e525-2152-4ac6-a5b2-930018f01c14" />

* After running floorplan:
<img width="1869" height="844" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/453ca2b7-3a26-4e6c-8c68-bff43a7cc2de" />

### Review floorplan files and steps to view floorplan

* We can use our floorplan results to calculate our DIE
* Floorplan results:
 <img width="1857" height="903" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c23869d5-1031-408e-8195-5a49dc476ccc" />

**FLOORPLAN:**
<img width="1919" height="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/43170bae-1d40-4c53-8ef9-ffd3436c689a" />

The command is : magic -T /home/vsduser/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/pdks/sky130A/libs.tech/magic/sky130A.tech lef read ../../tmp/merged.lef def read picorv32a.floorplan.def &

### Review floorplan layout in Magic

* We click left mouse click and right mouse click which creates a block and parallely pressing Z, zooms that specific part in.

## Library Binding and Placement
### Netlist binding and initial place design

<img width="1004" height="571" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8bb329d1-c042-4fde-ae96-ea87d0e87368" />

* The library will have the height and widht of every cell as well as its delay information.

<img width="309" height="387" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7a67984-3a87-4a31-9074-d7d9ed33970c" />

* The more bigger the AND Gate in size = less resistance = more faster.

### Optimize placement using estimated wire-length and capacitance

* **Placement**:

**1st logic:**

**2nd Logic:**

### Final placement optimization

**3rd Logic:**

**4th Logic:**

### Need for libraries and characterization

**Lib characterization and Modelling:**

<img width="1027" height="578" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/edd68673-a553-4341-9c36-120384206e8a" />

### Congestion aware placement using RePlAce

**When running placement (run_placement) in Openlane, These functions occur:**
* **Global Placement:** Reduces wire length
* Optimization and detailed placement

* We can look at it in the placement dir under results in MAGIC by typing in: magic -T /home/vsduser/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/pdks/sky130A/libs.tech/magic/sky130A.tech lef read ../../tmp/merged.lef def read picorv32a.placement.def &

As we can see the amount of standard cells above

* Zoomed in:
